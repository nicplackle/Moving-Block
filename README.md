# Moving-block

This game was made to experiment with moving DOM elements, react to keypresses and integrate collision detection.

## Objective

Make a game in which you move a square (in this case a luchador) in a gaming area and have it catch another square (in this case a taco, because luchador's love taco's duh).  Navigate using the arrow keys and have the 'taco'-square change it's location when eaten.

### Must-have features

- Square 1 (**luchador mask**) that can be controlled
- Square 2 (**Taco**) that can be picked up

## The Game

With the arrow keys (up, down, left & right) you can move the luchador in the square gaming area. There will always be one taco which you have to eat.  Once you eat it, another will appear.  The goal is to eat as many taco's as possible.  If the timer out the game is over.

## Credits

This game was made by me following an online tutorial.  I changed the styling, overall structure and themes.  The game is still under construction, so there are some bugs here and there, which I am trying to fix as we speak.
